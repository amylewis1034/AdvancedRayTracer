Distributed Ray Tracer.
While building it the following topics were explored:
shading, shadows, reflection, refraction, anti-aliasing, Cook-Torrance, Cook-Torrance GGX, Fresnel and Beer's Law, transformations, Euler angles, spatial data structures, bound-volume hierarchies, light theory, Monte Carlo Ray Tracing, hemishphere sampling, and global illumination.
